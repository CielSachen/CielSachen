A lazy university student attempting to become a **"good"** programmer in the _near_ future. Mostly familiar with the
frontend, but has _some_ experience with backend as well.

- Studying for a bachelors in Computer Science, majoring in Network and Information Security.
- Trying to learn more about the Rust programming language.
